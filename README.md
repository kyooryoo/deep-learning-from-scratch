Try to understand neural network from three perspectives:
* Math
* Diagram
* Code

Topics:
* Numpy array - pass
* type-checked function - pass
* Derivatives - pass
* Nested Functions - pass
* Chain Rule - the derivative of a nested function with respect to its
input is the product of the derivatives of its constituent functions.
